Description: 

	ZenTray is a system tray gadget that watches and displays the current alert level/severity from a Zenoss monitoring server.

	Clicking the icon will launch Zenoss in the default web browser. Right-clicking the icon will allow you to edit your server connection settings.

	New in version 0.2: The program will authenticate to the Zenoss (Zope) server using a form and cookies, which is the default login method.

Requires:
	Python 2.5+
	GTK+ Runtime 2.12.9+

Platform:
	Windows (portable excutable can be created with py2exe)

	I have only tested on Windows XP Pro SP3, but since this is created with Pyton and GTK+, it is probably compatible with other systems. YMMV.
